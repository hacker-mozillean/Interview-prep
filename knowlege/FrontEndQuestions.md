# Front-end Job Interview Questions

[Original Source](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)
This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

#### HTML Questions:

* What does a `doctype` do?
* What's the difference between full standards mode, almost standards mode and quirks mode?
* What's the difference between HTML and XHTML?
* Are there any problems with serving pages as `application/xhtml+xml`?
* How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
* What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?
* What are `data-` attributes good for?
* Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
* Describe the difference between a `cookie`, `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`.
* Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.
* Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
* What is progressive rendering?
* Have you used different HTML templating languages before?

#### CSS Questions:

* **What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?**
  - Classes and ID's are different ways to identify or tag html markup. Id's are unique, classes an be used mulitple times. There is some argument on whether or not to use ID's.
* **What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?**
  - resetting with css takes away all of the browser's defualt styling. Normalizing sets different browser's default to the the same so you are working from a consistant base. What I would choose would depend on the project and my needs. I usually choose normalize, but if I were doing something that needed a lot of special styling I might choose to reset the defaults so I can work from a clean slate.
* **Describe Floats and how they work.**
  - Floats let page other elements wrap around them. The term comes from print design, it describes text flowing around pictures. If an element has float right on it for example, the other elements on the page will appear to the left of the element. for items to not continue to flow around the element (for example to push a footer below a primary section) you'll need to clear them.
* **Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.**
  - z-index is the way that elemets are 'stacked' relative to the viewport. items with a lower z index will be 'below' elements with a higher z index. Stacking context is formed automatically and can be influenced by elements that need additional rendering (opacity change, transforms, etc) or if the z-index attribut is used.
  - MORE RESEARCH ON STACKING CONTEXT
* **Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.**
  - Block formatting context (BFC) is part of how the page renders in the browser. Things within elements are rendered in the same Block Formatting context. Floats, absolutely postitioned elements, inline blocks, table cells are some of the elements that create a new blcok formatting context.
  - MORE RESEARCH ON THIS
* **What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?**
  - Clear: both; This clears floats on both sides. You can also clear on one side.
  - MORE RESEARCH ON THIS
* Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - 
* What are your favourite image replacement techniques and which do you use when?
* How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
* How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers?
  * What techniques/processes do you use?
* **What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?**
  - display:none;
  - opacity: 0;
  - anser this none.
* **Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?**
  - I've used flexbox. I haven't used the new grid standards because they're not widely used in browsers, though I have looked into it and would adopt it. Flexbox is my favorite, it really makes sense to me, I've worked with it a lot. 
* **Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?**
  - Yes, in most projects. When you create a media query you add the screen sizes and types that you're customizing for then specify the way you want certain things to behave at that size.  Usually I design for a certain screen size (mobile first, for example)
* **Are you familiar with styling SVG?**
  - Yes.  SVG's are vector images rendered through canvas. Theyr'e easy to animate and much more space efficient than animated gif's. They're also more dynamic and often cleaner looking.

  - ... i don't.

* List as many values for the display property that you can remember.
* What's the difference between inline and inline-block?
* What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?
* The 'C' in CSS stands for Cascading.  How is priority determined in assigning styles (a few examples)?  How can you use this system to your advantage?
* What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change/improve them?
* Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?
