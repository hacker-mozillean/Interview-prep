# Learning Strategies and Resources

## Strategies

Memorization strategy checklist: 

1. Write it down without looking at the source
2. Say it out loud using different words than written
3. Close your eyes and think of any mental images that come to mind (free association, every random thing that pops up is valid)
4. Describe in writing some of mental images you conjured
5. Make up a rap or a song about it for 30 seconds (it doesn't matter how shitty it is)

Conceptual strengthening:

1. Pick a concept and attempt to come up with a helpful and appropriate analogy (not random like the free associating before)
2. Example: Imagine that two nodes on a directed graph are two people. Jane and Alfred. Jane is friends with Alfred, but Alfred is not friends with Jane. It is awkward. Whereas, in an undirected graph, the friendship flows both ways, Jane and Alfred are always friends with each-other.
3. This can be fun to do if you are working in a pair. Co-imagine together.

Note taking:

1. Use preferred note taking method (notebook, application). I have a desktop instance (space) open with https://www.calmlywriter.com/online fullscreen. I use dark mode with focus mode on. 
2. Write thoughts, questions, ideas, feelings etc. down every few minutes (like constantly non-stop reflection). Write what comes to mind. Don't edit, let it flow. 
3. Use note taking as a practice to help develop your meta-cognitive observer.
