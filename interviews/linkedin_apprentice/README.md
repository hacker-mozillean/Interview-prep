# LinkedIn Reach Apprenticeship

Date Applied: late January
Result: Rejected (Get more expierence)

Project based: You have one week to create a hangman game. After that point you'll come in for an interview to discuss your work.

My Project: https://github.com/rachel-ftw/hangman


Review: Overall this was a really great expierence. The LinkedIn recruiting team was really on point. They fulfilled all of their promises and were extremely organized and attentive. I would gladly apply there again.

I'm not dissapointed in their decision. I only had a couple hours to invest in the project and now that I know a little more about flux & data stores if I had to do it again it wouldn't be so bloated.

The interview was 2 hours long. I worked together with two engineers to fix some bugs and add a feature (full word guessing).
