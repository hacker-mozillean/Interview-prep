#### Emoji Cipher
July 11, 2016  |  [Github](https://github.com/bluemihai/lg-emoji-mellow-coatimundi)

Technologies Used: Node, Jasmine, Babel/ES2015, Heroku

We made a cipher that translates english into emoji and emoji back into english. This project was a huge stretch for me at the time, it was the first time I'd worked with node, testing, es2015, or babel. Or really building much that's functional in JS. I also ended up doing a lot of set up on my new computer.
