Technologies Used: Node, Jasmine, Babel/ES2015
First week at Learner's Guild! Feeling excited and nervous. Almost didn't walk in to door the first day because of anxious. Really glad I choose a back end project. This is the first time I'm working with node, testing, es2015, or babel. Or really building much that's functional in JS.
