## How to Use This Repo

If you are an **interviewee** (i.e. you are using this to practice your interviewing skills), use the `trials/` subdirectory to log your mock interview trials.

When you do an interview trial, follow these steps:

1. Make a new file in the `trials/` folder with the format `YYYYMMDD-NAME.md`, using the date of the trial and your name (e.g. `trials/20161228-Ada-Lovelace.md`)
1. Copy the contents of the `TRIAL.md` file into your new trial file
1. Update the information in your trial file
1. Do the mock interview with an interviewer
1. Once you are done
  - fill out the "Reflection" section
  - have the interviewer update the trial file with their questions and evaluation

If you are an **interviewer**, add your questions to the `questions/` subdirectory so that other interviewers can reference and use them. Also, you will be asked by the interviewee to write your evaluations in their trial file.
